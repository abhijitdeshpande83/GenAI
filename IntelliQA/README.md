# IntelliQA: Document-Grounded RAG System

## System Overview

IntelliQA is a **production-oriented Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) backend** for grounded question answering over private documents. Core logic ships as a Python wheel so the same package can power a notebook demo today and an API service tomorrow without rewrites.

> The driving question: **how do you make LLM answers reliable, multi-tenant, and operationally sustainable on private documents?**

## Problem Statement

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/problem-statement.svg" alt="Why Standard RAG Fails in Production: three pillars covering hallucination, prototype fragility, and embedding API costs" width="100%"/>
</p>

## TL;DR

IntelliQA is a packaged RAG backend that directly addresses each of the failure modes above. Sessions are **isolated** (no cross-user leakage), capped at **5 uploads** (abuse prevention), content is **deduplicated** at ingestion, and a **scheduled cron job** manages disk space. Generation runs on **Llama 3.3 70B via Groq** against a persistent **ChromaDB** store. Shipped as the `rag_pipeline` Python wheel and currently powering document Q&A on [theanalyticmind.com](https://theanalyticmind.com).

## ✨ Key Features

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/key-features.svg" alt="Six production-ready features: universal ingestion, session isolation, self-cleaning storage, smart deduplication, abuse-proof uploads, one pip install" width="100%"/>
</p>

## 🧠 System Design Philosophy

**1. Grounded Generation.** LLM runs at `temperature=0` and answers only from retrieved chunks. No speculation.

**2. Multi-Tenant Isolation.** Documents and queries are namespaced per session. Each user retrieves only from their own uploads.

**3. Operational Discipline.** Upload quotas, scheduled cleanup, and deduplication are first-class features, not afterthoughts.

**4. Package-First Distribution.** Core RAG logic ships as a Python wheel. The notebook is a demo. The wheel is the product, and it powers the live portfolio site.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

The system is organized into four layers:

**Ingestion** &nbsp;·&nbsp; Apache Tika parses multi-format input; deduplication and chunking happen before vectors touch the store.

**Storage** &nbsp;·&nbsp; ChromaDB persists 384-dimensional vectors from `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, namespaced by session.

**Generation** &nbsp;·&nbsp; Llama 3.3 70B Versatile (served on Groq LPU) generates answers bounded to retrieved context.

**Operations** &nbsp;·&nbsp; Session lifecycle, per-session upload quotas, and a daily cron job for cleanup.

## 🧠 Design Decision: Open Stack Over Managed APIs

## 🧩 System Components

| Component | Engine / Module | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Document Parser** | Apache Tika | Extracts text from PDF, DOCX, HTML, TXT, RTF, ODT, and dozens of additional formats |
| **Ingestion Pipeline** | `rag_pipeline.utils` | Parsing, chunking, deduplication, metadata extraction |
| **Session Manager** | `rag_pipeline` (custom logic) | Namespaces documents by session, enforces 5-file upload quota |
| **Vector Store** | ChromaDB | Cosine similarity search over 384-dim embeddings, disk-persisted |
| **Query Engine** | `rag_pipeline.query_engine` | Embeds questions, retrieves top-K chunks, orchestrates generation |
| **LLM Layer** | Llama 3.3 70B (Groq LPU) | Deterministic, grounded generation at `temperature=0` |
| **Storage Manager** | Cron + cleanup scripts | Daily removal of expired sessions, orphaned vectors, temp files |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker + AWS EC2 | Reproducible runtime, cloud deployment |

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Option 1: Install the Prebuilt Wheel
*Use this if you want IntelliQA as a ready-to-use RAG backend in your own application.* This is the path used by the live portfolio site.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhijitdeshpande83/GenAI.git
cd GenAI/IntelliQA
pip install dist/rag_pipeline-3.0-py3-none-any.whl
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Import and use anywhere:

```python
from rag_pipeline import query_engine, vector_store, utils
# See IntelliQA.ipynb for end-to-end usage examples
```

### Option 2: Install from Source
*Use this if you want to read, modify, or extend the core RAG logic.* The editable install (`pip install -e .`) picks up source changes immediately without reinstalling.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhijitdeshpande83/GenAI.git
cd GenAI/IntelliQA

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate              # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

export GROQ_API_KEY="your-key-here"
jupyter notebook IntelliQA.ipynb
```

## 🚧 Current Status

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Shipped** | Core pipeline, session isolation, upload quota, scheduled cleanup, AWS EC2 deployment, `rag_pipeline-3.0` wheel |
| **In progress** | RAG evaluation framework (faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision) |

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- RAG evaluation pipeline (faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision)
- Cross-encoder reranking on retrieved chunks
- Inline citations linking answers back to source chunks
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense vector)
- Streaming responses for lower perceived latency

## 💡 System Value

IntelliQA shows that a RAG backend can be **grounded, multi-tenant, operationally sound, and portable** without depending on managed APIs. The production discipline (session isolation, upload quotas, scheduled cleanup, deduplication) is built into the package, not bolted on later.
